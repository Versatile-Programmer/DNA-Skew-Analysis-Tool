# DNA Skew Analysis Tool

## **Project Details**

This is a simple tool that calculates the cumulative skew values of a DNA sequence from any microbe.

With this tool, you can plot graphs showing different combinations of skew values against DNA segments.

*   **Segments:** Groups of 100 DNA bases (A, T, G, C).
*   You can also determine the minimum and maximum skew values in the sequence.

## **How to Use?**

1.  Upload a file (the file should only contain A, T, G, C characters, and the first line must be the name of the bacteria).
2.  Click on the button for the skew analysis graph you want to generate.
3.  The tool will generate and display the skew analysis graph, which you can download for further use.

## **Tools and Technologies**

*   Built using React.js and Vite for high performance.
*   No data is stored on any server—this tool runs entirely in your browser.
*   Completely free and open-source—you can even download the generated graphs for your projects.
